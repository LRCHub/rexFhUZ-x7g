Black 'n blue
Broke down on the floor in my
bedroom
Right here, right now
I'll use my favourite trick to
get me off
I'll close my eyes
All I wanna do is get away
I'll be fine
'Cos I'm heading for my sweet
escape
(When I was)
Dancing in the dark with the boy
I met in Paris
In, in the front row of my radio
show
I didn't catch his name
But it didn't even matter
We were dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark with the boy
I met in Paris
In, in the front row of my radio
show
Underneath the stars
Stole my heart with his rhythm
We were dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark
Time after time
I'm daydreaming of the night
that you were mine
Didn't know what that meant
But I know it's one night I
won't forget
I'll close my eyes
And all I wanna do is get away
I'll be fine
'Cos I'm heading for my sweet
escape
(When I was)
Dancing in the dark with the boy
I met in Paris
In, in the front row of my radio
show
I didn't catch his name
But it didn't even matter
We were dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark with the boy
I met in Paris
In, in the front row of my radio
show
Underneath the stars
Stole my heart with his rhythm
We were dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark
He'll never know
How he saved my life that night
If he's in a cafe
I hope this song will play
And he'll remember
'Cos I remember
Dancing in the dark with the boy
I met in Paris
With the boy I met in Paris
Dancing in the dark with the boy
I met in Paris
In, in the front row of my radio
show
I didn't catch his name
But it didn't even matter
We were dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark (with the
boy I met in Paris)
Dancing in the dark with the boy
I met in Paris
In, in the front row of my radio
show
Underneath the stars
Stole my heart with his rhythm
We were dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark
With the boy in Paris
With the boy in Paris
With the boy in Paris
We were dancing in the dark,
dancing in the dark
